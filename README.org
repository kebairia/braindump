Hi, my name is *Zakaria.K*, and this is my *braindump*.
This repository contains my ``[[file:org-files/20210106222617-zettelkasten.org][Zettelkasten]]-based'' working/study/reading notes.
They're in a messy state right now, but they'll be improved as I get used to the method.
The majority of them are literature notes that I took while reading.

I intend to create a dedicated website for them in the near future.

Have a good time!
