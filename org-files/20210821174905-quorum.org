#+title: quorum

- quorum is the minimum number of votes needed to achieve more than half of the votes. 
- if the quorum is achieved, the cluster is considered *quorate*
- the cluster loses quorum if half of the nodes or more cannot communicate with each other.
- any node loses its membership, get fenced by other nodes (the [[id:1abdaccd-ed06-49d9-9332-2363aca40e63][majority]])

* Example
  lets imagine a 5 nodes cluster (A, B, C, D and E)
  and lets consider that they use a file server as a shared storage
  imagine that D and E loses their communication with A, B and C
  the majority here goes to (A,B,C) so these nodes still form a quorum for this cluster, and they will [[id:d3715650-d854-4e79-889c-92793964bd80][fence]] E and D
  otherwise and without the concept of quorum, D and E suppose that the problem is with A,B and C, and they try to remount the file server again
here we will get one file system mounted two time in two different places, which leads to data corruption, this situation called [[id:a29b6919-cbef-4314-95ed-c568f045521e][split-brain]]
