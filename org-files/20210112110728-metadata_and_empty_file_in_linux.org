#+title: metadata and empty file in linux
#+roam_tags: linux metadata inode size
when you create a file without any data in it by [[file:20210112111033-touch_command.org][touch command]] for example.
~touch myfile~
~ls -l /tmp/myfile~
you'll get a file with a size == ~0 bytes~.

but why?, is'nt there a name and some data related to this file, so the size of the file must be bigger than ~0 bytes~.

actually these data are called ~metadata~ and are not saved on the file itself, but it depends on the filesystem you use.

so for example, if you are using [[file:20210112111835-ext4_filesystem.org][ext4 filesystem]] for example, these metadata will be stored in the [[file:20210112111942-inode.org][Inode]] of the file.

you can see all the inodes availlable and used on each partition in your system, by invoking the following command:
~df -i~ 
or for more human readable format use the ~-h~ option: 
~df -hi~

and the number of the [[file:20210112111942-inode.org][Inodes]] you have left will decide how many files you can create in future on this perticular partition.
