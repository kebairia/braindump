#+title: IPMI
#+filetags: :protocol:hardware:remote:kvm:computer-science:

- IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is an low level old protocol for controlling and monitoring servers remotely, independent of the host's CPU,  firmware (BIOS/UEFI) and operating system.

- For example :: we can use IPMI to managed a computer of server that may be powered off or otherwise unresponsive by using a network connection to the hardware rather than using an operating system.
- Also we can use it to install an operating system remotely
  The specification is led by Intel and first published in Sep 1998
- It's supported by many vendors (Intel, Cisco, Dell, Supermicro)

- This reminds me by [[id:0a9d3323-7447-4f28-818a-a93f93eddf55][PiKVM]], and How it helps us to remetely control any computer using the network.
- You can see that PiKVM is Hardware independent, it's not a protocol, it's a RasperryPI with KVM and [[https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm][DIY]] code installed on it.
- I saw an [[https://kaydron1000.github.io/pikvm/docs/pikvm-configuration/ipmi][article]] of using IPMI protocol to control multiple PiKVM together, and That PiKVM support IPMI.
  But IPMI is not recommended due to security issues, and it's advised to use Redfish KVMD API
