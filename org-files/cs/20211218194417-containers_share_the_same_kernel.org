#+title: containers share the same kernel
#+filetags: :filesystem:linux:

As we might know, a distribution is just the Linux kernel with a specific set of tools and packages, package manager ...etc

So we can mimic a minimal operating system or a distribution by sharing this kernel, and 
creating another filesystem of top of it, and isolate this filesystem, restrict system resources.
And by that, we created another distribution into the actual distribution.
