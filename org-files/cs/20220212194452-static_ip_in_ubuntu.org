#+title: static ip in ubuntu
#+filetags: :computer-science:
PS: There is a new tool called [[id:3ff6226f-7a39-4fc4-b747-3e5b6c8ea64a][netplan]] in recent version of ubuntu, the method described below is old, yet is still supported.
- the file that contain the network interfaces configuration is =/etc/network/interfaces=
  #+begin_src sh
    vim /etc/network/interfaces
  #+end_src

  a. for =dhcp= configuration
     #+begin_src conf
       auto eth0
       iface eth0 inet dhcp
     #+end_src
     Then the interfaces will send DHCP request, and get its IP address from the nearest DHCP server

  b. for static IP configuration
     #+begin_src conf
       auto eth0
       iface eth0 inet static
       address 192.168.2.2
       netmask 255.255.255.0
       gateway 192.168.2.1
       dns-search example.com
       dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
     #+end_src
  c. To SHUTDOWN the interfaces and bring it UP again
     #+begin_src sh
       sudo ifdown eth0
       sudo ifup eth0
     #+end_src
  d. You can see the inforamtion of all interfaces with =ifconfig -a=
