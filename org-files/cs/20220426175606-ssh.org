- SSH stands for *Secure SHell* and was invented in 1995.
- It's a OpenBSD project.
- Before that, people were using other utilities like =telnet= (1970s), [[id:d16440b8-cb02-4296-8633-880e34802bf7][rlogin]], that was before the rise of the internet,
  There was no need to encrypt the traffic because all the networks used back then was private or internal (universities for examples).

- SSH was a need in the age of the internet.

* Basic usage
#+begin_src sh
  ssh user@192.168.2.1
  ssh user@remote_host
  ssh user@remote_host -p 2200
#+end_src
* Basic architecture
It's has a client-server architecture where :
- The client if from where you connect from
- The server if to where you will connect to

The package =openssh-server= is required to make your host an "ssh server"
#+begin_src sh
  sudo yum install openssh-server
#+end_src
The =/etc/ssh/sshd_config= is the configuration file for the server side
The =/etc/ssh/ssh_config= is the configuration file for the client side
