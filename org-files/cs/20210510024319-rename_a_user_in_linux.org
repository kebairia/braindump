Under Linux, the usermod command changes user names.
It modifies the system account files to reflect the changes that are specified on the command line.

To change just the username:
#+begin_src sh
usermod --login <new_username> <old_username>
#+end_src

To change the username and home directory name:
#+begin_src sh
usermod --login <new_username> --move-home --home <path_to_the_new_home_dir> <username>
#+end_src

You may also want to change the name of the group associated with the user:
#+begin_src sh
groupmod --new-name <new_username> <old_username>
#+end_src
- sometimes, the new group have a different *GID* from the old one
- you can use the ~find~ command to look for all the files and directories with a specific *GID*, and change there group owner
  #+begin_src sh
    sudo find / -gid 1001 2> /dev/null -exec chown -v :admin {} \;
  #+end_src
