#+title: non/authoritative answer in DNS
#+filetags: :network:computer-science:

When you request a URL (let say you used nslookup for that for example), DNS can provide you with one of two answers: 
Authoritative (when the response comes from the master dns server) or non-authoritative (when the response comes from a secondary dns server).
The secondary DNS server serves as a backup server and only caches the most recently requested URLs.
The secondary DNS server obtains information from the master DNS server and stores it in a cache for future requests.
