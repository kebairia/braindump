#+title: "--" in bash-built-in commands
#+filetags: :options:man:shell:grep:computer-science:
=--= in used in most bash-built-in commands and other commands to signify to the end of command options, after which only positional arguments are accepted.
#+begin_src sh
grep -- -v file
#+end_src
- The example above, the =--= meant the end for =grep= to accept options, here =-v= doesn't mean the reverse matching, but rather, grep here search for =-v= word in =file=.
- We can use this option to search for options in =man=, documentations, or files that have =-= or special characters in their names, 
- =man bash=
#+begin_comment
--   A -- signals the end of options and disables further option processing. Any arguments after the -- are treated as filenames and arguments. An arguments of - is equivalent to --
