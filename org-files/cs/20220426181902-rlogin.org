rlogin (remote login) was a program that allowed users to access a computer remotely.
First introduced in BSD Unix in the 1980s
rlogin, like telnet, was superseded by [[id:b266a53c-5617-44e7-af30-9012c1a18197][ssh]] because and with the rise of the internet, a more secure utility to remotely use computers was required, and rlogin and telnet both sent data in clear which was inconvenient.
