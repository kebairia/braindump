- what facebook and [[file:20210323145437-social_media.org][social media]] made us is something like a reaction-machine
- you will have to react as soon as possible for a tremendous number of posts in short amount of time, repeatedly
- you have to react and give your opinion on trends and topics you don't care about, or don't know anything about.
- you have to create an alternative personality that react,  to sustain its ego/value/existence...etc
