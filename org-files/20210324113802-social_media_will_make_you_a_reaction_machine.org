#+filetags: social_media independence
- what facebook and [[id:5b2190ca-0361-45e3-bc4b-4862c6159ced][social media]] made us is something like a reaction-machine
- you will have to react as soon as possible for a tremendous number of posts in short amount of time, repeatedly
- you have to react and give your opinion on trends and topics you don't care about, or don't know anything about.
- you have to create an alternative personality that react,  to sustain its ego/value/existence...etc
