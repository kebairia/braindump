- [[id:ed96a909-3749-46d4-b64b-0840d5308ae8][individualism]], the concept of seeing oneself as capable and accountable for
  his own life, his body, and his choices,"[[id:fd5a4c5f-b137-4ed4-bb01-b49178026185][independence]]" is one of the ideas that influenced
  ideologies and social movements like [[id:161c5341-fbca-4ea5-9a01-91169f8bffb9][feminism]].

- Women in the past took the same attitude that was popular at the time, the belief
  that "the one" is a part of "the group" and cannot be alone or make his own decisions,
  and that the only thing that matters is the group's safety and prosperity.

- Women saw the same thing since it was the "common sense" and the only way of perceiving
  and understanding the world.
  hence , women had a role in the group, and they can't put the safety of the group on the
  stick only for selfish desires like "living my own life" or "taking my own decisions"
