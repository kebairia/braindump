[[id:4c72a4b7-ee23-473d-a50d-39060c7cbb9e][emacs]] starts when Richard stallmann added the ability to run macro to the TECO editor (Text Editor and Corrector).
with a Guy named "Guy Steele", Richard create a large collection of custom macros, and when these macros accumulated, they created a environment haundling them and they named it "EMACS", which means "Editing MACroS"
after that, and on 1979, emacs became the main editor used in MIT AI Lab.
