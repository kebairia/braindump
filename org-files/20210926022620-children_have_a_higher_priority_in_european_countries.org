#+title: children have a higher priority in European countries
Children are given a higher priority in European countries, not only because it is a natural
right for human beings (especially children), and not because they are the ones who will build
the country in the future, but also because these countries face a wave of people who choose
not to have children in the first place and for a variety of reasons.

such as the fear of passing on illness to the new child, or the idea of living once without the
intervention or burden of responsibilities of a valuable creature like a "human baby".
