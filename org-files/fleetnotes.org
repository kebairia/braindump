* Tue, 01 Feb 22 (13:23) : peer reviewed
- Peer reviewing can be done by engaging in scientific communities.
- we can't do that because accessing to papers is restricted and hence --> expensive 
- so it's really difficult for an independent research to do his own research, unless he engage with organized institutions
  - This institution is politically biased sometime, and has it's own ideology, and also politically corrected
* Tue, 01 Feb 22 (13:27) : peer reviewing
- is the method of rechecking and reviewing the work of others
  and reviewing their papers and work
- it's an essential part of the scientific work
- all the publisher such as (Nature, Science ...etc) has their own group of scientist
  who review and look at the paper that come to this publisher.
- some people argued that the publishers use their peer reviewing process to 
  the researcher to follow one way of thinking, and that they suppress the researcher
  who say odd claim, or the claim that don't follow some agenda's
- this put the whole process in question
- their was a podcast for luke that talked about that, that I have to check

- Here in a video named "The early days of Unix at bell labs"
  Brian kernighan talked briefly about bell labs and nobel prizes that it won.
* Thu, 03 Feb 22 (10:01) : carl sagan, ann druyan article
- the importance of the daily routines, or as Sasha Sagan putted: "daily rituals"
#+begin_quote
everything that we do in a special way, and has (holds) meaning to us is a ritual,
especially, when there are other ways of doing it.
#+end_quote
- 'our deepest fears powers so much what we do'
#+begin_quote
I came to understand that I could never get to the complete picture.

So the metaphor changed. Instead of a puzzle, being curious became more like being a collector of small, beautiful objects, of which there are a seemingly infinite number on Earth, like seashells or stamps.
#+end_quote
- Yes, instead of seeing that learning new things is like adding new pieces to the puzzle,
  you'll soon realize that the puzzle doesn't have any edges, and learning new things is like
  collecting beautiful pieces or objects.

* Thu, 03 Feb 22 (19:11) : science is about performances
- The common thing that I see between the philosopher of science (science studies as I will check that later)
is that, they all agree on the usefullness of science, the fact that 'science just work'
- here, on page 93 on the book 'why trust science' [see the org-noter's note there]
I saw latour arguing about: that science is about performances, and science was the best way to perform and know about the world.
- througout history, scientist tried to be adherents or skeptics about science, but I see that all of them gave a common result
  that put some faith, and trust in science, or as I said above, they all agree on the fact that 'science just work'

* Sat, 05 Feb 22 (07:21) : universal morals
- search about and learn about universal morals
* Sat, 05 Feb 22 (22:26) : western way of science
- in GG YouTube channel, I noticed that, he always say
  the western way of diagnostics for example, all the western way.
- in one of his videos, he said that the western way of diagnostics to population based.
  for example: if a scientist diagnosis a person that he is a narsist, he relate that person
  to a group, and treat him by the rules and ways that was effective with this group that have similar
  behavior
- the western science is not individual based, but it tries to group people for example into groups that
  have similar characteristics, and treat person that were diagnosis as they belong into a specific group
  by the rules and ways of treatment that belong to that group
- You need to think about that good enough, and do you research about it
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_NRIVq2vzM][How to Have A Personality - YouTube]]
* Sat, 05 Feb 22 (22:33) : the western science again
- search and learning about the development of the western science
  can lead me to think about a new way to doing science, investigating nature
  and also finding answers and exploring the world
* Mon, 07 Feb 22 (23:39) : can our state of mind influence our biochemistry and immune system?
in the book, seeking wisdom from Darwin to Munger, this question related to the placebo definition.
using a placebo here to demonstrate the relation between what we think and our bodies is great.
what we think affect the way our bodies behave and react.
* Mon, 07 Feb 22 (23:42) : placebo and moral dilemma
some people argue that using the placebo pills (sugar pills) is immoral because it's like cheating the patient.
and taking their money without doing anything, and pills that the doctor gives the patient are just sugar pills,
therefore, charging the patient for sugar pills is cheating and stealing, call it whatever you want, the result is 
an immoral behavior from the doctor.
- but the thing here is that, using the placebo pills can actually affect the brain, and for that, we can say that 
  and placebo pills is a new way of treatment that let us trigger the brain to heal and body by it self.
  it is exactly, or barely the same thing that we do using the traditional medicines, trigger the brain and body to heal it self
* Tue, 08 Feb 22 (08:48) : why history repeat itself?
History repeats itself very often because nature changes with geological time, and man is equipped to respond in humans-life time.
- also humans are equipped with stereotyped ways in dealing with events, stereotypes for responding for things like hunger,
  danger, sex ...etc
* Sat, 12 Feb 22 (09:59) : our usage of words
- today, I was listening to a track in the waking up app
  and Sam was explaining the meaning of 'meditation'.
  and in the middle of the track, I notice that, a lot of the words that we
  use in our daily life are delusional. 
  for example: we tend to feel as humans that there is a self in the center of our consciousness 
  and that led us to discuss the philosophical idea "mind/body" problem for example.
  - but what if there was no self, meaning that, the mind/body problem. The distinction between our
    mind and the body is just a result of some sort of consciousness mechanism that led us to feel 
    the "self" for example.
  - What if all of our philosophical problem and discussion are only limited to the nature of our bodies and consciousness
    and are not objective, are knowledge doesn't represent the true nature of the world, but rather the way we perceive this word.
    And the way we perceive this world is based in the way we developed over the years
  - Doesn't that means that all of our knowledge is subjective to our nature.
  - I think that this has a relation to the idea of "Bat's perspective"
  - And the question that arise after that: How can we be sure that our knowledge is, in some sort related to the objective nature of the world.
  - Yes, I can understand the idea that: Our knowledge is not objective, and doesn't necessarily represent the true nature of the world.
    and it's correct in the way that it has relation to this objective nature.
  - Like when I can know if my speed has increased, without a speed-monitor, if I knew that my speed related to another speed that I have
    a monitor on
* Fri, 25 Feb 22 (06:54) : 
- people have an aversion to loss.
  They fear to loose something they have, more than wanting to gain something they don't have.
