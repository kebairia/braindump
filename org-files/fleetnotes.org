* Tue, 01 Feb 22 (13:23) : peer reviewed
- Peer reviewing can be done by engaging in scientific communities.
- we can't do that because accessing to papers is restricted and hence --> expensive 
- so it's really difficult for an independent research to do his own research, unless he engage with organized institutions
  - This institution is politically biased sometime, and has it's own ideology, and also politically corrected
* Tue, 01 Feb 22 (13:27) : peer reviewing
- is the method of rechecking and reviewing the work of others
  and reviewing their papers and work
- it's an essential part of the scientific work
- all the publisher such as (Nature, Science ...etc) has their own group of scientist
  who review and look at the paper that come to this publisher.
- some people argued that the publishers use their peer reviewing process to 
  the researcher to follow one way of thinking, and that they suppress the researcher
  who say odd claim, or the claim that don't follow some agenda's
- this put the whole process in question
- their was a podcast for luke that talked about that, that I have to check
* Wed, 02 Feb 22 (00:40) : bell labs and nobel prizes
- Here in a video named "The early days of Unix at bell labs"
  Brian kernighan talked briefly about bell labs and nobel prizes that it won.
* Thu, 03 Feb 22 (10:01) : carl sagan, ann druyan article
- the importance of the daily routines, or as Sasha Sagan putted: "daily rituals"
#+begin_quote
everything that we do in a special way, and has (holds) meaning to us is a ritual,
especially, when there are other ways of doing it.
#+end_quote
- 'our deepest fears powers so much what we do'
#+begin_quote
I came to understand that I could never get to the complete picture.

So the metaphor changed. Instead of a puzzle, being curious became more like being a collector of small, beautiful objects, of which there are a seemingly infinite number on Earth, like seashells or stamps.
#+end_quote
- Yes, instead of seeing that learning new things is like adding new pieces to the puzzle,
  you'll soon realize that the puzzle doesn't have any edges, and learning new things is like
  collecting beautiful pieces or objects.

* Thu, 03 Feb 22 (19:11) : science is about performances
- The common thing that I see between the philosopher of science (science studies as I will check that later)
is that, they all agree on the usefullness of science, the fact that 'science just work'
- here, on page 93 on the book 'why trust science' [see the org-noter's note there]
I saw latour arguing about: that science is about performances, and science was the best way to perform and know about the world.
- througout history, scientist tried to be adherents or skeptics about science, but I see that all of them gave a common result
  that put some faith, and trust in science, or as I said above, they all agree on the fact that 'science just work'

* Sat, 05 Feb 22 (07:21) : universal morals
- search about and learn about universal morals
* Sat, 05 Feb 22 (22:26) : western way of science
- in GG YouTube channel, I noticed that, he always say
  the western way of diagnostics for example, all the western way.
- in one of his videos, he said that the western way of diagnostics to population based.
  for example: if a scientist diagnosis a person that he is a narsist, he relate that person
  to a group, and treat him by the rules and ways that was effective with this group that have similar
  behavior
- the western science is not individual based, but it tries to group people for example into groups that
  have similar characteristics, and treat person that were diagnosis as they belong into a specific group
  by the rules and ways of treatment that belong to that group
- You need to think about that good enough, and do you research about it
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_NRIVq2vzM][How to Have A Personality - YouTube]]
* Sat, 05 Feb 22 (22:33) : the western science again
- search and learning about the development of the western science
  can lead me to think about a new way to doing science, investigating nature
  and also finding answers and exploring the world
* Tue, 08 Feb 22 (08:48) : why history repeat itself?
History repeats itself very often because nature changes with geological time, and man is equipped to respond in humans-life time.
- also humans are equipped with stereotyped ways in dealing with events, stereotypes for responding for things like hunger,
  danger, sex ...etc
* Sat, 12 Feb 22 (09:59) : our usage of words
- today, I was listening to a track in the waking up app
  and Sam was explaining the meaning of 'meditation'.
  and in the middle of the track, I notice that, a lot of the words that we
  use in our daily life are delusional. 
  for example: we tend to feel as humans that there is a self in the center of our consciousness 
  and that led us to discuss the philosophical idea "mind/body" problem for example.
  - but what if there was no self, meaning that, the mind/body problem. The distinction between our
    mind and the body is just a result of some sort of consciousness mechanism that led us to feel 
    the "self" for example.
  - What if all of our philosophical problem and discussion are only limited to the nature of our bodies and consciousness
    and are not objective, are knowledge doesn't represent the true nature of the world, but rather the way we perceive this word.
    And the way we perceive this world is based in the way we developed over the years
  - Doesn't that means that all of our knowledge is subjective to our nature.
  - I think that this has a relation to the idea of "Bat's perspective"
  - And the question that arise after that: How can we be sure that our knowledge is, in some sort related to the objective nature of the world.
  - Yes, I can understand the idea that: Our knowledge is not objective, and doesn't necessarily represent the true nature of the world.
    and it's correct in the way that it has relation to this objective nature.
  - Like when I can know if my speed has increased, without a speed-monitor, if I knew that my speed related to another speed that I have
    a monitor on
* Fri, 25 Feb 22 (06:54) : 
- people have an aversion to loss.
  They fear to loose something they have, more than wanting to gain something they don't have.
* Sun, 27 Feb 22 (13:22) : individualism and freedom
the individualism create so much freedom.
This will cause more confusion for the individual
Likewise, when there are more options in front of us, it becomes difficult for us to choose

Example :
Marriage
In a book by Alain de Botton, he speaks that, in the old days, when we had no choice but to marry
the neighbor's daughter, because she was the only girl available in the area, and such a young man
had not seen another girl, nor a more beautiful girl, he did not see that he was deprived of anything .

Contrary to what we see today, the first problem that might occur between two persons in a relationship,
one or both of them will think about the possibility of finding better person, which will only increase
the suffering.

Sometimes, happiness is a choice , constructed by awareness 

- one of the things that make the paradox of choice occur, is that we don't know what we want in front, and don't know our needs, because we don't understand ourselves.
- for me, the idea of abundance doesn't necessarily  must be physical, just knowing that their are other options, and your possibility to 
  reach these choices is enough, as they say, it just need more effort to achieve that, which will create sense of guilt with every choice to made, because you will feel that you were responsible for that, totally responsible, and that will create more suffering.
- I think that there is a relation to the middle-age crisis
* Sun, 27 Feb 22 (13:50) : so many choices leads to a decrease in happiness 
#+begin_quote
Schwartz found that having this unparalleled plethora of choice in the modern world was actually causing people to be less happy with their decisions
#+end_quote
* Sun, 27 Feb 22 (14:01) : knowing your limits
- knowing your limits might be a way to avoid the suffering that came with the paradox of choice.
* Sun, 27 Feb 22 (14:03) : relations [ paradox of choices]
- see if there is a relation between how the meaning of love shifted in the latest years,
  and the paradox of choices.
- for example: if the increase of people that can read, and the kind of novles that was published,
  and how that affected the way people see love and relations, knowing that there are other choices in this live.
  and also facing other kind of stories, like romeo and Juliet.
- if the emerge of multiple stories like that made an abundance of choices that people can choose.
* Sun, 27 Feb 22 (14:20) : knowing your self and knowing what you want.
- I think that knowing yourself, and knowing what you want is a great way to avoid the paradox of choices.
- it's like: the difference between cars-noob that can be scammed by an unwanted car.
  and an car expert that can choose the right car that fit among multiple choices.
* Sun, 27 Feb 22 (14:47) : great idea [paradox of choice]
#+begin_quote
The researchers concluded that while an abundance of options might initially seem attractive to consumers,
having too many options might actually cause someone not to make any decision at all.10
#+end_quote
- this have a relation to idea of: choosing the default, that I read it in "Seeking wisdom" book
- if there was too many options, we tend to not choose any, and maintain our default state.
* Sun, 06 Mar 22 (23:38) : why Iam against using sexy positions/photo in pop-songs
- because it target the primeval side of us, and we should use abstract endeavors for instead
* Fri, 18 Mar 22 (15:49) : the abandance
- I was watching "Carol 2015" movie, and at the time: 1:07:43 
  carol said: "again" to re-hear the song again
- At this moment I thought about the abandance that we live in nowadays; we can hear, and re-hear song to the degree that we begin to hate them.
- the abandance of song, the chance to hear them. the abandance of food.
- I think that, this is also the cause for the boredom that we feel nowadays.
- Scarcity make things valuable.
* Mon, 21 Mar 22 (14:07) : about the heliocentric system
Ptolemy thought that, the stars are too small, which may leads to the 
conclusion that the earth is stationary and the stars revolve around it
* Fri, 25 Mar 22 (20:01) : evolution and empathy for strangers
- I read sometimes about how empathy for strangers can be explained with evolution.
  the problem that I see is that, these explanation try to create a direct relation
  between the two subject that we try to study.
  but sometimes, some humans behavior can't be explained with this kind of approach
- take empathy for strangers for example, may be it's the result of empathy and the strong
  relation with whom we have blood relation, but it's nature and rocket science
  and the evolution of such behavior can have "taux d'erreur" which lead to strange behavior
  like sacrificing for total strangers 
* Fri, 25 Mar 22 (20:57) : thinking about the endless of the universe
- think how our universe is endless, and infinite.
- is this finite measurements and limits that we see and feel has a relation only to the 
  way we perceive the world?
- I was watching " *Ryuu to sobakasu no hime* ' movie, the movie that Norene gave me, and I had this 
  insight on time 28:14 when we entered the stadium, it has millions and millions of characters
- here I thought that, virtually, we can create an infinite world, we wont encounter the limitation that
  we have in real life, we can create an endless stadium with ease, a stadium that can holds billions
  and not only millions.
- is our world like that, is the endless and the infinite nature of our universe is like that
  and the only limitation of the finite nature that we see has a relation to our nature and limitation
  and a species
