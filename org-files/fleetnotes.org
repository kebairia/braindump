* Tue, 01 Feb 22 (13:23) : peer reviewed
- Peer reviewing can be done by engaging in scientific communities.
- we can't do that because accessing to papers is restricted and hence --> expensive 
- so it's really difficult for an independent research to do his own research, unless he engage with organized institutions
  - This institution is politically biased sometime, and has it's own ideology, and also politically corrected
* Tue, 01 Feb 22 (13:27) : peer reviewing
- is the method of rechecking and reviewing the work of others
  and reviewing their papers and work
- it's an essential part of the scientific work
- all the publisher such as (Nature, Science ...etc) has their own group of scientist
  who review and look at the paper that come to this publisher.
- some people argued that the publishers use their peer reviewing process to 
  the researcher to follow one way of thinking, and that they suppress the researcher
  who say odd claim, or the claim that don't follow some agenda's
- this put the whole process in question
- their was a podcast for luke that talked about that, that I have to check

* Thu, 03 Feb 22 (10:01) : carl sagan, ann druyan article
- the importance of the daily routines, or as Sasha Sagan putted: "daily rituals"
#+begin_quote
everything that we do in a special way, and has (holds) meaning to us is a ritual,
especially, when there are other ways of doing it.
#+end_quote
- 'our deepest fears powers so much what we do'
#+begin_quote
I came to understand that I could never get to the complete picture.

So the metaphor changed. Instead of a puzzle, being curious became more like being a collector of small, beautiful objects, of which there are a seemingly infinite number on Earth, like seashells or stamps.
#+end_quote
- Yes, instead of seeing that learning new things is like adding new pieces to the puzzle,
  you'll soon realize that the puzzle doesn't have any edges, and learning new things is like
  collecting beautiful pieces or objects.

* Thu, 03 Feb 22 (19:11) : science is about performances
- The common thing that I see between the philosopher of science (science studies as I will check that later)
is that, they all agree on the usefullness of science, the fact that 'science just work'
- here, on page 93 on the book 'why trust science' [see the org-noter's note there]
I saw latour arguing about: that science is about performances, and science was the best way to perform and know about the world.
- througout history, scientist tried to be adherents or skeptics about science, but I see that all of them gave a common result
  that put some faith, and trust in science, or as I said above, they all agree on the fact that 'science just work'
