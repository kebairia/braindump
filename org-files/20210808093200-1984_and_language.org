#+title: 1984 and language
- there is this idea of 'the new language' in the [[id:583fba5a-abc2-499d-ae8b-46854392a6c9][1984]] novel by [[id:2ea78bb2-edb7-4b94-a3f6-7914dfa721d4][george orwell]].
  the idea of that, the party has invented a new language called "the New Language" with only few, specific and chosen word so that people can't express themselves or their concerns any more
  because they don't have the words to describe it
- the idea was that, you can control the minds by controlling the language people use, and by limiting the words people know, you are limiting their ability to describe their position, fears or hopes
- i wander how is that is related the work of [[id:84d7b21f-3740-4773-8edd-894e5c861178][ludwig wittgenstein]] on language and his contribution in the [[id:bae4c8bc-d2bc-4a2b-b9ef-5fe8d2e83dd3][philosophy of language]], and how can language sometimes fools us to believe in things that doesn't exist.
