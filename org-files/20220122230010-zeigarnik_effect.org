Our brain doesn't distinguish between finished tasks the those we write down on *GTD* system for example.
and that's is one of the main ideas of the David Allen's work in "Getting things done"
same happen with the [[id:9d0a4d0d-065d-41e5-8fb4-fb49b5cdb5c4][zettelkasten]] system, when you know that your thoughts and insight are in a "trustful" system.
you'll not care or fear from loosing them, you trust your system, and its ability to re-bring your ideas again when you need them.
