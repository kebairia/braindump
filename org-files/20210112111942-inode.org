#+title: Inode
#+filetags: inode linux size
the inode is a unique number that is realted to a specific file, so that the system can recognize this file and destinguish it from other files.
when you first format a partition on a disk, the filesystem you use/choose will decide the amount of inodes you can use, and that will decide the number of files you can create on this partition. 
you can use ~man mkfs.<filesystem>~ to see all the options that are related to the inodes.
also, you can use ~df -hi~ to see the amount of indoes you have on a particular partition
