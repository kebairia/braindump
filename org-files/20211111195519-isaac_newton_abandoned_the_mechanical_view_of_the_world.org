#+title: Isaac Newton abandoned the mechanical view of the world
#+filetags: :revolution:paranormal:gravity:mechanical cosmos:science:
i saw this argument before, and i wrote about it on [[id:8e1ba51d-76e0-4190-bd54-bada9cb0d603][2021-08-24]] 
the main idea here is that [[id:7e139c4c-ed85-4dc5-b29d-798649d297a2][Issac Newton]] abandoned the mechanical view of the world
when he developed his theory of gravity.
back then, the mechanical nature of the cosmos and the world was a doctrine, and 
other scientists couldn't understand the idea of a mysterious force that can
attract and effect other physical objects.

But with Newton's theory of gravity, he was somehow saying that:
"There is an unseen force, let's call it gravity, that can force and effect other
objects, and make them attract each other""
It was like a paranormal phenomena for other scientists, and i can see why they 
rejected it back then.
