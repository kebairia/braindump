#+title: Karl Popper and Paul Feyerabend
There is a relation between the two philosophers ([[id:e68f0b2d-1f12-4598-91c5-03cf0cf42086][Karl Popper]] and [[id:7027cab9-3f21-4717-8219-c470bf00482a][Paul Feyerabend]]).
that is the idea of "everything goes". Yes, this is what Paul Feyerabend said,
but Karl also says the same thing about the source of insight and thoughts that comes to the scientist.
After that, what matters is the method of separating the nonsense from what is truly scientific.
hence, [[id:cd487f20-6afa-4e4c-a766-6cb394737c0c][Demarcation problem]]
