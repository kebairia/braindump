#+title: violence as a mean to change
#+filetags: :society:violence:
Any strategy that imposes itself on people by violence will fail to achieve
its goal, and will instead provoke a violent reaction from the people.

As a result, it is best to focus only on the things that are absolutely necessary
for our goal of change.
