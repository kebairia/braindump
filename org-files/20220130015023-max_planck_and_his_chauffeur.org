after a while, his chauffeur propose the following:
"Would you mind, Professor Planck, because it’s so boring to stay in our routine. 
What if I gave the lecture in Munich and you just sat in front wearing my chauffeur’s hat?"

Max Planck agreed.
After that, the chauffeur gave the lecture, and then, a proffesor who was one of the audiauce ask a well defined question about the subject
of the lecture, and the chauffeur replied:
""Well I’m surprised that in an advanced city like Munich I get such an elementary question.
I’m going to ask my chauffeur to reply."
