Tips on how install/use the minted package with latex
i faced problems using it on arch Linux and with [[id:4c72a4b7-ee23-473d-a50d-39060c7cbb9e][emacs]] using [[id:6ce3c5bf-44cc-419a-b881-07f4000c79a4][org-mode]]
the problem is that until now i didn't understand the weird results i get using it with org-mode
 
- install minted package
#+begin_src sh 
  # Arch
  sudo pacman -S minted
  # Ubuntu
  sudo apt install minted
#+end_src
- install the python-pygments package
#+begin_src sh 
  # Arch
  sudo pacman -S python-pygments
#+end_src
*NOTE*: until now, i didn't find the root of the problem, what i did is that i just reinstalled the python-pygments
and i compiled the ~.tex~ file with the command line using src_sh[:exports both]{xelatex -shell-escape <filename>.tex}
