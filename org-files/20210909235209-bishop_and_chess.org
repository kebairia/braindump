#+title: bishop and chess
#+filetags: :chess:
In chess, the bishop must only walk in straight lines; does this have
anything to do with the fact that in [[id:ba5ad8e8-836f-4e51-b540-720812bfff31][Christianity]] , the bishop is a symbol
for a straight man, or the idea that in Christianity, and as a bishop,
you must follow our God's guidance, the straight *path*?
