This is a story about Richard Feynman's and his father

See that bird? It's a brown-throated thrush, but in Germany it's called a halzenJugel and in
Chinese they call it a chung ling and even if you know all those names for it, you still know
nothing about the bird. You only know something about people; what they call the bird.
Now that thrush sings, and teaches its young to fly, and flies so many miles away during
the summer across the country, and nobody knows how it finds its way.

words, definitions, (prons and cons) doesn't gives us knowledge, it's only fill our head with "the illusion of knowledge".
