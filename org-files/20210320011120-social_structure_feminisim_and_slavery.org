- why there are a lot of [[file:20210320011154-feminisim.org][feminisim]] right now, has it a relation with the social structure.
- for example: look at [[file:20210320011342-slavery.org][slavery]], human society could not reject slavery without the changes that appears in the social structure and the industrial revolution, there were no need for human labor for a lot of jobs hence slavery , here humans become thinking seriously in slavery as an evil think
- same with feminism and women right, before industrial revolution , there wasn't any chance for women right to be taken seriously, because after the industrial revolution, a lot of woman work, like laundry and cooking were a critical think that make the transfer into a society without these roles for woman something not possible
