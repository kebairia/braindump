- why there are a lot of [[file:20210320011154-feminisim.org][feminisim]] right now, has it a relation with the social structure.
- for example: look at [[file:20210320011342-slavery.org][slavery]], human society could not reject slavery without the changes that appears in the social structure
  and the industrial revolution, there were no need for human labor for a lot of jobs hence... no slavery,
  here humans become thinking seriously in slavery as an evil thing.
- same with feminism and women rights, before industrial revolution, there wasn't any chance for women rights to be taken seriously,
  because after the industrial revolution, a lot of woman's work, like laundry and cooking were a critical thing that make
  the transfer into a society without these roles for woman, something impossible.
