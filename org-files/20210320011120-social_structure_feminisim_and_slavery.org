- why there are a lot of [[id:161c5341-fbca-4ea5-9a01-91169f8bffb9][feminisim]] right now, has it a relation with the social structure.
- for example: look at [[id:8c1b44f0-2069-4ae7-8a32-a880dd1819af][slavery]], human society could not reject slavery without the changes that appears in the social structure
  and the industrial revolution, there were no need for human labor for a lot of jobs hence... no slavery,
  here humans become thinking seriously in slavery as an evil thing.
- same with feminism and women rights, before industrial revolution, there wasn't any chance for women rights to be taken seriously,
  because after the industrial revolution, a lot of woman's work, like laundry and cooking were a critical thing that make
  the transfer into a society without these roles for woman, something impossible.
