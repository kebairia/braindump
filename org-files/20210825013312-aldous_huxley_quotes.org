"The perfect [[id:ca473045-c398-482b-81fa-4caf71e959e8][dictatorship]] would have the appearance of a [[id:0b730bba-3af4-4b21-8379-475f504af711][democracy]], but would basically be a prison without walls in which the prisoners would not even dream of escaping. 
It would essentially be a system of [[id:8c1b44f0-2069-4ae7-8a32-a880dd1819af][slavery]] where, through consumption and entertainment, the slaves would love their servitudes."
