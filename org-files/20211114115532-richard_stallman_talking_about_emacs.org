This is a quote from an article for [[id:61cd1ad8-3ff2-460c-bab0-3e2031992cd0][Richard Stallman]] talking about the idea behind [[id:4c72a4b7-ee23-473d-a50d-39060c7cbb9e][emacs]] and it's [[id:ee383775-408a-46ac-9451-ed389c477e65][elisp]] programming language
#+begin_quote
The interesting idea about Emacs was that it had a programming language, and the user's editing commands would be written
in that interpreted programming language, so that you could load new commands into your editor while you were editing.

You could edit the programs you were using and then go on editing with them. So, we had a system that was useful for things
other than programming, and yet you could program it while you were using it.
I don't know if it was the first one of those, but it certainly was the first editor like that.
