[[file:img/Catch22.png][catch-22]]
A catch-22 is a paradoxical situation from which an individual cannot escape because of contradictory rules or limitations.
The term was coined by Joseph Heller, who used it in his 1961 novel Catch-22. An example is:

"How can I get any experience until I get a job that gives me experience?" – Brantley Foster in The Secret of My Success.
"I have to be married to get a house, but to get married I must have a house"
