* Form of ruling according to Plato
#+begin_quote
[[id:c4adaf11-01fd-4860-aaa7-7dfc52c61139][Plato]] was the first theoretician to make a system out of the distinctions between what he regarded as the main forms of the city-state.
According to the number of the rulers, he distinguished between:
1. monarchy, the rule of one good man, and tyranny, the distorted form of monarchy;
2. aristocracy, the rule of a few good men, and oligarchy, its distorted form;
3. [[id:0b730bba-3af4-4b21-8379-475f504af711][democracy]], the rule of the many, of all the people.
   Democracy did not have two forms. For the many always formed a rabble, and so democracy was distorted in itself.

* Why we choose [[id:0b730bba-3af4-4b21-8379-475f504af711][democracy]] ?
#+begin_quote
We could base our whole theory on this, that there are only two alternatives known to us: either a [[id:ca473045-c398-482b-81fa-4caf71e959e8][dictatorship]] or some form of democracy.
And we do not base our choice on the goodness of democracy, which may be doubtful, but solely on the evilness of a dictatorship, which is certain.
Not only because the dictator is bound to make bad use of his power, but because a dictator, even if he were benevolent, would rob all others
of their responsibility, and thus of their human rights and duties.
