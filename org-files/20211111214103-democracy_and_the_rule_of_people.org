#+title: democracy and the rule of people
#+filetags: :society:social_media:democracy:

I can understand why ancient people rejected the idea of [[id:0b730bba-3af4-4b21-8379-475f504af711][democracy]].
democracy by definition is the rule of the people, and the leaders back then saw
that the majority of people knew nothing about politics, ruling, or wars;
they were farmers and regular people, so how could we trust these people with our lives?
