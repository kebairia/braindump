#+title: golden ratio
#+filetags: :design:mathematics:

we can say that there is a golden ratio (represented by the Greek letter $\phi$ or $\varphi$) between two quantities:
if the ratio between two quantities is the same as the ratio between the sum of the two quantities
to the larger quantity of the two quantities. 

Expressed algebraically by (for quantities $a$ and $b$ with ${a>b>0}$ ):

${\displaystyle {\frac {a+b}{a}}={\frac {a}{b}}\equiv \varphi .}$
