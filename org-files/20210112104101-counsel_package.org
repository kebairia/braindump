we can use now ~counsel-package~ to install/delete packages [[id:4c72a4b7-ee23-473d-a50d-39060c7cbb9e][emacs]] with the new version of [[id:9a01fa89-958b-4eb7-a368-59644f24f849][counsel]] 
M-x counsel-package, then precede the name of the package with ~-~ for deleting and ~+~ for installing
when you first type ~-~, ~counsel-package~ will show you only the packages that are already installed.
same with ~+~, it will show you only the packages that are'nt installed

it will update/fetch your package repositories infos every 4hours, like when we execute the ~package-refresh-contents~ .
that was, somehow annoying, at least for me, because i have very slow internet.
