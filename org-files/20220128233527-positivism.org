It was a Scientific movement in the 19^th century, formulated by [[id:4f2b9a47-c434-4909-a7ca-9672bd41b772][Auguste Comte]]
It claims that: Science is the only way to gain reliable and true knowledge in which we can put our trust.

Meaning of positivism:
In English we say:
A) "Are you positive" (meaning "Are you sure!")
B) "Yes, Aim" (meaning "Yes, Iam sure")

Here Auguste Comte meant by positivism: that only science can gives us a "Positive knowledge" and a reliable one.
