#+title: choosing a distro in production
#+filetags: :linux:

Before choosing a Distro for a company, consider the following questions:

- Is this distribution going to be around in 5 years?
- Is this distribution going to stay on top of the latest security patches?
- Does this distribution have an active community and sufficient documentation?
- If I have a problem, will the vendor talk to me, and how much will that cost ?
