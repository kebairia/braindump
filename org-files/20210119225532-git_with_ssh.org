we can use our [[file:../../../org/notes/20210119230640-ssh.org][ssh]] public-key to fetch and push our code from/to github repo
so instead of linking your remote repo the traditional way, we can use our [[file:../../../org/notes/20210119230640-ssh.org][ssh]] public key instead.
1) add your [[file:../../../org/notes/20210119230640-ssh.org][ssh]] public key to your github profile
   - go to setting --> SSH and GPG keys --> New ssh key, then paste your public key there [ ~~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub~ content]
2) then link your local repo with your remote repo/branch
   - ~git remote add git@github.com:<user>/<repo's name>~
   - example: ~git remote add git@github.com:kebairia/braindump~
3) Now we can do ~git fetch~, ~git pull~ and ~git push~ without the strugle of typing our password everytime, but if you setup your ssh-keys with a passphrase, you have to type it everytime,

   any way, this is much better way dealing with your github account.
