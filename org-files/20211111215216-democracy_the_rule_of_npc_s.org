#+title: democracy the rule of npc_s
#+filetags: :society:social_media:democracy:

One of the well known critics for [[id:0b730bba-3af4-4b21-8379-475f504af711][democracy]] is that:
"democracy by definition is 'the rule of people', and people are dumb
therefore democracy is the rule of dumb people"
and of course when we say people, and describing them as 'dumb', we mean 
anyone other than us, right !!
that was a lovely passage that i like, and it's from an episode from from an episode of
Luke Smith's good podcast 'not related.'
This episode's title was Democracy, the Rule of NPCs.
