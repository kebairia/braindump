#+title: scientific revolution and weird ideas
#+filetags: :revolution:science:

I see that, with every revolutionary idea that yield to a [[id:48002b4b-7228-401d-b90e-81fc77d12061][scientific revolution]].
there is some sort of "rejection" for the main paradigm and the doctrines that 
govern the scientific community
it's like what [[id:f62c5b96-e8dc-4fa9-a52a-3ae631fba9f1][Thomas Kuhn]] described in his book "the structure of the scientific revolutions"
and also the same thing that [[id:7027cab9-3f21-4717-8219-c470bf00482a][Paul Feyerabend]] describe in his book "against method", when he 
mention Galileo and how his theory was, and according to the scientific method that we 
follow right now, was untrue.
but time reveals to us that Galileo was right, and he was right because he reject the stereotypical 
view of "how science should work"
