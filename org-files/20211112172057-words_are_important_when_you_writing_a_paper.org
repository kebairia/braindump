#+title: words are important when you writing a paper
#+filetags: :writing:

in a course named "The Craft of writing effectively" the professor said the following:
#+begin_quote
Take 15 min a week, for the rest of the year, taking articles in your fields, print them out,
and circle every word in the writing that is creating value to the readers
#+end_quote

I got from that the following insight:
Our mission is to gain reader's attention, so that can care enough about our work/writing
that we see at valuable and deserve attention
