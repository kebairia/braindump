#+title: myths and the invention of writing
#+filetags: :writing:myth:

I consider the relationship between [[id:874918a3-8098-49aa-b4eb-703627aab3f6][myth]]s and the [[id:7f8b89af-45ce-42cb-b24f-e4509d101f5f][invention of writing]].
Before humans invented writing, all culture and human experience were only oral, resulting in a
higher risk of cultural and human experience being distorted.

Consider an event that occurred in a tribe, and the tribe's members attempted to pass this experience
to the next generations as a story worthy of mention and discussion, in other words, a "[[id:37ebf808-c4ad-4a80-a338-e26b1752927e][meme]]" without
the technology of [[id:0a3afa5c-2e08-46c4-b723-f09b33bafe0e][writing]]. This story will be distorted, modified, and exaggerated, and it will carry
a lot of the tribe's emotions and culture, the way they see the world, and so on...

- Is there a link between the invention of writing and the decline of myth as a way of world description?
