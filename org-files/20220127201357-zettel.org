The most basic requirement for every zettel is:
+ A unique indentifier [link] :: A unique address so that you can reference it later.
+ Content :: the actual gem, and must contain only one thought.
+ Reference :: a reference from where you got the idea or the insight, this will help you later if you want to give credit for others, any if you want to re-read the idea from the source, and elaborate on it
