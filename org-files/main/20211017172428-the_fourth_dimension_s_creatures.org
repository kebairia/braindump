#+title: the fourth dimension's creatures
#+filetags: :time:freedom:free will:4D:philosophy:
The creatures that lives in the fourth dimension for example, have a concrete and higher
level of free will.
Think about it!, they can move in the fourth dimension freely, which means that they can
control the time of their death, they are immortals.
A creature from this dimension has the choice to live (to be immortal), or to choose
the time of his "end", of course unlike us (we live in a 3D-based reality ).

- I got the insight from the "True detective" series, season 1
