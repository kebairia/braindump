It's a method of measuring distances, targeting objects using laser.
It measure the differences between the times of the light of the laser to determine the different distances.
It can also be used to create a 3D visualization about terrestrial surfaces, the bottom of oceans, and distances places like other planes.
We can also consider another application for that technology, such as the one described in "Black Moon," a sci-fi novel by "Yasser abu el hassab," in which a robot used this technology to walk on the Moon
