#+title: in the past, why things remains the same for a long time ?
#+filetags: :history:

One of the things that kept things unchanged in the past for a long time, if the idea of sufficiency
Things like furniture and tools remained the same for a long time before capitalism introduced us to the idea of constant change and development.

Because these tools remained unchanged, the habits and the traditions remained unchanged as well.

[[id:78983bd0-b2f9-46e1-bf70-3a7ced39a590][capitalism]] uses humans desires for new things and their curiosity about the unknown to make more profit and money, , but in the past, sufficiency was the objective, and if something proved beneficial, it was refined again and again.

That is why crafts and the elders' wisdom were valued.
