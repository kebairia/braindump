#+title: reading physical books is faster
#+filetags: :read:habit:book:

I found that reading physical books is a lot faster than the reading on laptop.
One of the reasons for me is that, with laptop, it's a lot easier to be distracted by notification, changing workspace or web browsing.
Reading physical books create [[id:e01ef402-7211-46c3-acb9-f2bf111bdd97][natural breaks]] between tasks, reducing stress and the feeling of being overwhelmed.
