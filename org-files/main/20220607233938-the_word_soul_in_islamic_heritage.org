#+title: The word soul in islamic heritage
#+filetags: :soul:islam:

In my cultural and religious heritage, I feel or recognize the word "Soul" or "روح" to be something like "air", something refreshing.

Because there is this verse of Quran that says "و نفخ فيه من روحه", here the word "نفخ" has this feeling of pushing something like air, something refreshing to the body of a humans from the soul of God. 

And like that, I have this feeling of refreshing related to "soul" and hence "Live", something beautiful and pleasing.

Is there another way to understand the word "نفخ" ?

sometime the word "Soul" has a relation to the [[id:6731e002-a2f3-4b83-bd74-48077e411b44][mind-body problem]].
some people refer to consciousness also by "Soul".
