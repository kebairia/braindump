#+filetags: :taboo:science:curious:banning:book:

- Banning a book is its best publicity, because in general, humans are curious creature, and always tend to know mysterious thing and the causes of things, private stuff ...etc.
- That's why they invented science, and they like doing it.
- an example of that, is when Morocco banned a book titled "A homosexual diaries"
