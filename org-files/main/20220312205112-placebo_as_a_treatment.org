#+title: placebo as a treatment

Some argue that using placebo pills (sugar pills) is unethical because it is defrauding the patient.
And taking their money without doing anything, charging the patient for sugar pills is cheating and stealing, whatever you call it.

However, using placebo pills can actually affect the brain, and as a result, we can say that placebo pills are a new way of treatment that allows us to trigger the brain and the body to heal itself.
It does the same thing (or almost the same thing), as traditional medicines in terms of triggering the brain and body.
