- Peer review can be done by engaging in scientific communities.
- We can't do that because accessing to papers is restricted and hence, expensive,
  so it's really difficult for an independent researcher to do his own research, unless he engage with an organized institutions.
- These institutions are politically biased and has its own ideology, as well as being politically corrected.
