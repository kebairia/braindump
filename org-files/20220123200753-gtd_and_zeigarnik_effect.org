  and that's is one of the main ideas of the David Allen's work in "Getting things done".

- same happen with the [[id:9d0a4d0d-065d-41e5-8fb4-fb49b5cdb5c4][zettelkasten]] system, when you know that your thoughts and insights are in a "trustful" system,
  you'll not care or fear from loosing them, you trust your system, and its ability to re-bring your ideas again when you need them.
