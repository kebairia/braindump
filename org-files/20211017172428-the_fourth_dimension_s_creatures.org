#+title: the fourth dimension's creatures
#+filetags: :time:freedom:free will:4D:philosophy:
The creatures that lives in the fourth dimension for example, have a concrete and higher
level of [[id:04bbbe2d-c2ba-42b0-9733-ae141f6355a9][free will]].
Think about it!, they can move in the fourth dimension freely, which means that they can
control the time of their death, they are immortals.
A creature from this dimension has the choice to live (to be immortal), or to the choose
the time of his "end", of course unlike us (we live in a 3D-based reality ).
