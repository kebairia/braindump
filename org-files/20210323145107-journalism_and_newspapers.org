- It seems that the press has been a leap in the creation and development of collective awareness among the public, because [[file:20210323145408-newspapers.org][newspapers]] are considered a cheap and easy way to receive information, communicate and read for thinkers;
  unlike books, which were costly to the public who struggle daily to survive.
- [[file:20210323145408-newspapers.org][Newspapers]] are a revolutionary work, the inexpensive medium that created a channel of communication between "[[file:20210323145301-intellectuals.org][intellectuals]]", "[[file:20210323145328-politicians.org][politicians]]" and the public.
- And do not forget how this method can be used to influence public opinion, in a much better way than the traditional method, which used to rely on a person giving speech in public squares,
  see the limitations and cost of the old method and its less influence compared to [[file:20210323145408-newspapers.org][newspapers]].
