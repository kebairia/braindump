Worse is better (the New Jersey style): a term refers to the argument that software quality does not necessarily increase with functionality.
there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a prefereable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability.
limited and simple software may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.
the term conceived by [[id:a342a630-e703-4410-85f5-fafce2e59b9e][Richard Gabriel]] in an essay of the same name.
