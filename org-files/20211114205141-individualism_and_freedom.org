#+title: individualism and freedom
the individualism create so much [[id:2120d4c5-8fc3-4783-9d73-c993161db818][freedom]].
This will cause more confusion for the individual
Likewise, when there are more options in front of us, it becomes difficult for us to choose

Example :
[[id:f49d30a5-bc87-47bf-835d-eac56506e46c][Marriage]]
In a book by Alain de Botton, he speaks that, in the old days, when we had no choice but to marry
the neighbor's daughter, because she was the only girl available in the area, and such a young man
had not seen another girl, nor a more beautiful girl, he did not see that he was deprived of anything .

Contrary to what we see today, the first problem that might occur between two persons in a relationship,
one or both of them will think about the possibility of finding better person, which will only increase
the suffering.

Sometimes, [[id:af88b58b-4b92-4213-a699-b6ec4d9d93ec][happiness]] is a choice , constructed by awareness
