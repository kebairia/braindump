#+title: git credential
#+filetags: :credential:token:git:
although you can use ssh transport to connect to your remote repos
this will allow to push and pull from your remote repo without a username
or password (if you use a empty passphrase)
this isn't possible with HTTP protocols.

using a token with your GitHub account will prompt you for your username
and password every time you interacted with your remote repo
here the solution is to use [[id:c73ba657-73b7-452d-ae96-e4ec648c1103][git]] credential, which will create a file that
cache your credentials for a period of time, or permanently
- the default is not to cache at all, it will prompt you for username/password
  every time
- =cache=: keeps your credential in memory for a period of time(default: 15min )
  nothing will be stored on disk
  #+begin_src sh
    git config --global credential.helper cache
    # you can specify the amount of time to cache 
    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 3000'
  #+end_src
- =store=: save your credential to a plain-text file on disk, and they never expired.
  the downside here is that your password is stored in clear text to a file
  #+begin_src sh
    # this will store your credential to ~/.git-credentials
    git config --global credential.helper store
    # you can specify where plain text is saved
    git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.config/git/credentials'
  #+end_src
all of this specification will be saved on you =gitconfig= file
