#+title: dependencies isuue in arch linux
#+roam_tags: linux installing tricks

you can use ~pacman -Rdd <package>~ to uninstall a package and overcome its complain about package dependencies.
for example, i had an issue lately installing the ~libxft-bgra-git~ on archlinux, because there was a another package called ~libxft~, and that makes a conflict and i could'nt uninstall it.
- the solution is to use ~pacman -Rdd libxft~ to uninstall the package and overcome the =error= message, than installing the ~libxft-bgra-git~ package using ~yaourt~.
