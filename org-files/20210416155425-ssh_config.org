#+title: ssh config
#+roam_tags: unix linux ssh config
for better [[file:20210119230640-ssh.org][ssh]] workflow, you can use a ~config~ file in the ~~/.ssh~ folder  (~~/.ssh/config~) with the following content:
#+begin_src conf
Host targaryen
    HostName 192.168.1.10
    User daenerys
    Port 7654
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/targaryen.key

Host tyrell
    HostName 192.168.10.20

Host martell
    HostName 192.168.10.50

Host *ell
    user oberyn

Host * !martell
    LogLevel INFO

Host *
    User root
    Compression yes
#+end_src
- of course when using a name with the *User* option, this name must be declared in the ~/etc/hosts~ file.
- ~Host * !martell~ meaning all hosts except martell
