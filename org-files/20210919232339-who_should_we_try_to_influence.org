#+title: who should we try to influence?
#+filetags: :society:

- Instead of focusing on the men and women who are living right now,
we need to focus on next generation and set an examples for the younger.
#+begin_example
- explain and discuss a better way to live.
- how we can respect each other and cherish human life and human dignity.
- how we can change the way we look and treat women,...etc.
#+end_example
- I agree that some older people can alter their minds and their bad behavior,
  but they are a minority, and we can't put our hopes in them to make society a better place.
