#+filetags: :society:

- Instead of focusing on the men and women who are living right now,
we need to focus on next generation and set an examples for the younger.
#+begin_example
- explain and discuss a better way to live.
- how we can respect each other and cherish human life and human dignity.
- how we can change the way we look and treat women,...etc.
#+end_example

  but they are a minority, and we can't put our hopes in them to make society a better place.
- the [[id:76945c21-573b-46ad-9b22-f3e36dc3b9ab][change must be in a democratic environment]] so that intellectual people will
  have a voice, and by that they can influence and make a difference in the younger
  then in the societies that they will build and rule.
