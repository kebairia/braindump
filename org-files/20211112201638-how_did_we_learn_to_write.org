#+title: How did we learn to write?
#+filetags: :writing:learning:

We learned to explain things with the assumption that the reader is a person who will comprehend it,
and that's why we don't know how to describe things we say.
we say: ahh it's complicated,
I understand it but I don't know how to convey it to you.
