#+title: hard and soft links
#+filetags: :filesystem:linux:
the difference between hard links and soft links
the hard link point to the same [[id:532b6b8d-cc16-4544-bccd-880eb0110e89][inode]] of the original file (if we can call it original).
where, the soft link only point to the file itself
that why we need to delete all the hard link of a specific file, to be fully deleted. 

and when we delete the original file, the soft link become a broken link, because it points to nowhere
