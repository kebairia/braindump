A structure note is a meta-note that contain the structure of all other [[id:379a19e2-4229-481e-9355-b83b2e5239d4][zettel]]s
- For example:
  - Here on org-roam, I used a note that sometimes doesn't contain any content
    but play the role of 'a starting-point' for a bunch of other related Zettles, or a concept, a topic ...etc
  - I can use org-roam-ui, but I don't like the look of it, sometimes I need a structural text file only, it's simple and practical.
- but this is might seen as a short-view for the power of the [[id:9d0a4d0d-065d-41e5-8fb4-fb49b5cdb5c4][zettelkasten]] method.
  one must not limit his zettelkasten growth, and for that, a note might have multiple parent.
