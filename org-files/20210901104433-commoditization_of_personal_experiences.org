[[id:5b2190ca-0361-45e3-bc4b-4862c6159ced][social media]] encourage for the commoditization of our personal experiences.
an example for that is the stories of girls that were raped, and the way they use that for self-branding
by playing the victim role.
this remind me by the vague reason that some [[id:161c5341-fbca-4ea5-9a01-91169f8bffb9][feminists]] use and their slogan "we believe survivalists"
and the false accusation that appeared in 2020 in Egypt [look for the name/story of the trend back then]

we must find a way to verify these stories, because the accusation of rape is realy dangerous.
