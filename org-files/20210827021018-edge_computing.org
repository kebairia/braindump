pushing the computation process to the edge of the network
edge computing solve a lot of [[id:4e8506f5-6512-4165-a267-a1962326c5c7][cloud computing]] problem:
1. very short response time, unlike cloud computing which suffer from high latency
2. maintain data privacy, because raw data kept on the edge, and we only send the data we want
   after local processing.
3. with sensors spreaded everywhere (with the use of [[id:25e4956a-308d-489c-a025-c50ae9efe1d8][internet of things]] approch),
   large quantity of data generated which could be a heavy load for networks, which
   cause problem 1
