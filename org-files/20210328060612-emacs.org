Emacs is a text editor - or is it ? - developed by [[id:61cd1ad8-3ff2-460c-bab0-3e2031992cd0][Richard Stallman]]
#+begin_quote
Emacs is not a text editor, this is a common misnomer.
It is far more apt to describe Emacs as a Lisp machine providing a generic user-centric text manipulation environment.
That’s quite a mouthful. In simpler terms one can think of Emacs as a platform for text-related applications.
It’s a vague and generic definition because Emacs itself is generic.
