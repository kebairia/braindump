#+title: save specific layout in emacs
#+filetags: :emacs:layout:window:trick:

we can save a specific layout in [[id:4c72a4b7-ee23-473d-a50d-39060c7cbb9e][emacs]] with ~M-x window-configuration-to-register~ and then we type a letter for it, lets say we choosed 'a'.
after that we can restore this layout with ~M-x jump-to-register~ than the letter we choosed. in this example it was 'a'
~M-x window-configuration-to-register - a~
~M-x jump-to-register - a~
