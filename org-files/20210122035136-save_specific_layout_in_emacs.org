#+title: save specific layout in emacs
#+filetags: emacs layout window trick

we can save a specific layout in emacs with ~M-x window-configuration-to-register~ and then we type a letter for it, lets say we choosed 'a'.
after that we can restore this layout with ~M-x jump-to-register~ than the letter we choosed. in this example it was 'a'
~M-x window-configuration-to-register - a~
~M-x jump-to-register - a~
