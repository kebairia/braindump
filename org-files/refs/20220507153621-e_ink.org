e-ink is a technology for creating a paper-like displays.
The first appears of this technology was in the MIT Media Lab in 1997, and the technology commercialized after that by E Ink Corporation.

The idea of this technology is the following:
It uses micro-particles with different colors (black and white) and different charges (+positive charge white particles, negative charges for black particles).
The particles are so tiny (the width of the human hair).
These mirco-particles are squeezed between two transparent layer, and every pixel of these layers can have a positive or a negative charge.
So the charge of the pixel will attract the micro-particles with the opposite charge.
(positive charge of the pixel will attract the black miro-particles and vise versa)
