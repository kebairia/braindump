e-ink is a technology for creating a paper-like displays.
The first appears of this technology was in the MIT Media Lab in 1997, and the technology commercialized after by E Ink Corporation
The idea of this technology is the following:
It uses micro-particles with different colors (black and white) and different charges (+positive charge white particles, negative charges for black particles)
the particles are so tiny in the size of the width of the human hair 
these mirco-particles are squeezed between two transparent layer, and every pixel of these layer can have a positive or a negative charge.
so that the charge of the pixel will attract the micro-particles with the opposite charge. (positive charge of the pixel will attract the black miro-particles and vise versa)
