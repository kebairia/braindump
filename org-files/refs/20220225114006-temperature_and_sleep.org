#+title: temperature and sleep
#+filetags: :ancestor:sleep:

- Our ancestor, the hunter gatherer's, went to sleep not at the sunset (when it get dark), but few hours after that.
  And they didn't get up with sunrise, but right before that, when the temperature rise up.
- The idea is that our sleep depends on several factors and not only the amount of light in our surroundings.
- Temperature play a major role in that.
  - When our core body temperature drop down 1 Degree Celsius, we tend to fall asleep.
    and we get up again the temperature rise up (right before the sunset)
- This is also has a relation to the [[id:d0d37fc7-34c9-4d59-9b79-c152d4552c85][warm bath effect]], because the increase in our core body temperature from taking a bath, and going into a colder environment -- like our bedroom -- will do the same effect.
