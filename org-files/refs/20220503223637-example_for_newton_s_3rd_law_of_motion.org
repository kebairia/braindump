#+title: example for Newton's 3rd law of motion

There is a great example that demonstrate Newton's Third law of motion.
Take 5 or 6 balls linked from above with a string, like the artifact that we usually see in offices
move one ball and then let it hit the rest of the ball, you will see only one ball on the other side move in the same direction and return.
then move 2 balls now, you will see 2 balls will move simultaneously on the same direction and return.
then move 3, 4 and you realize that the same balls will move every time on the other side
this is a great demonstration for that, the same amount of energy is moving through the balls .
