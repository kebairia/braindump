#+title: why history repeats itself?
#+filetags: :history:

- History repeats itself very often because nature changes with geological time, and man is equipped to respond in humans-life time.
- also humans are equipped with stereotyped ways in dealing with events, stereotypes for responding for things like hunger, danger, sex ...etc
