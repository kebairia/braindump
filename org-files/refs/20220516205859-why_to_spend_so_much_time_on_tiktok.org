#+title: why to spend so much time on tiktok ?
#+filetags: :pleasure:control:tiktok:addiction:

There was a study claims that, we spend to much time on tiktok and similar platforms (Youtube shorts...etc) 
because (and according to the study):
When people in the study took a higher number of videos sequentially, then tend to spend more time on these platform if:
- They knew the title of the video( so they have an idea about the content of the video before)
- Here people tend to choose similar videos, because they get pleasure watching the first videos, so they try to re-watch a sequel because
  there is more chance to have the same pleasure again
- If I watched a video for Bunnies, and I got pleasure doing that, I'll try to re-watch a similar video, because I create some kind of trust
  on these kind of videos to have pleasure
- That's why platform like Youtube and TikTok use AI to suggest "similar content", and that what create a "Rabbit hole", and make you spend hours watching them
