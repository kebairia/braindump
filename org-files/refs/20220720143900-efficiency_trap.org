  The more efficient you are, the more tasks you are assigned,
  the more emails you respond to, the more replies you get, the busier you will become.
  Also, your efficiency will earn you a good reputation, and more people will contact you because they guarantee your responsiveness.
- efficiency trap 2
  The more tasks you complete in a short period of time, the shallower these tasks are.
  Your brain will postpone harder tasks that require more focus for later, and you will be drawn to easier tasks.
  At the end of the day, you will realize that you only completed easy and unimportant tasks.
