#+title: our minds are symbolic
#+filetags: :rational:argument:

Meaning that when we remember an event, we don't remember all the details of the event, but rather we remember our feelings and reactions to
that particular event.

This is what create problem in discussions/when arguing, we don't give the whole picture about a particular event,
we give and only remember our side of the story without the details, only our emotions and reaction to it, which make it more difficult  to consider it accurate or objective.
